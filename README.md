# MNSITneuralNet
A basic neural net written in only python using MNIST database.
\
----- A work in progress ----- 
\
This neural net currently uses mean squared error to calculate the loss, however I plan on switching to cross entropy loss.
\
For the hidden layers, the relu activation function is used, leaky relu in the crossEntropy branch
\
For the output layer, softmax activation is used.
